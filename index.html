		<div class="text">
			Since we have challenges ranging from all sorts of categories and difficulties, everyone will find something to do at X-MAS CTF 2019. The main goal here is to have fun, and to hack.
			<br><br>
			Some of the categories that we will have are the classic Web Exploitation, PWN, Reverse Engineering and Crypto, up to some more unique ones like Hardware, OSINT, and even Emulator-Writing.
			<br><br>
			We hope to see you on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/9dwXTKF">Discord Server</a> at the time of the competition.
